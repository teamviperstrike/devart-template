## Project Description
I believe that words have power. This project will attempt to capture the dual meaning behind the word "power". In an effort to benefit society at large, I hope to expose the power in the words we say to one another.

This project will allow individuals to speak, out loud, and repeat pre-written self-affirmations. Each individual will be encouraged to keep repeating these phrases, at a louder and louder volume. The decibels produced by this will be captured and used to bring up lights around the individual. Analysis will then be given to show the individual just how much power their words generated.

Hopefully, this will open a conversation in society that speech is powerful, and we may be able to use our words to change the world.


## Example Code
NOTE: Wrap your code blocks or any code citation by using ``` like the example below.
```
function test() {
  console.log("Printing a test");
}
```
